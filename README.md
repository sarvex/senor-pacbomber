# El Se√±or Pacbomber

## The unholy combination of PacMan and Bomberman

### [Created for the Bevy Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2)

- The music will sound weird for the first ~4 seconds and then its fine. Seems to be a WASM issue.
- I started learning bevy this weekend, so the code is.. not actually optimal. But I managed within the deadline
- Many cool things are missing (more bomb radius, smarter enemies, faster enemies)

It was still great fun to build this.
